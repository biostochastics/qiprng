## Impact and Compatibility

These changes are designed to be fully backward compatible with existing code. The improvements focus on reliability and thread safety without changing the API or expected behavior.

### Key Improvements

- **Thread Safety**: The library is now fully thread-safe and can be used in multi-threaded environments without crashes
- **Stability**: All known segfault issues have been fixed, particularly in the normal distribution generation during thread cleanup
- **Robustness**: The code now handles edge cases and error conditions gracefully
- **Correctness**: Statistical properties are maintained despite the implementation changes

### Known Limitations

- The library still produces MPFR "inexact result" warnings during initialization and operation
- Ziggurat method automatically falls back to Box-Muller in some edge cases for stability
- Ziggurat method is not used when both `use_threading` and `use_parallel_filling` are enabled (Box-Muller is automatically used instead)
- Parallel buffer filling may cause stability issues in some environments and is not recommended for production use
- The thread-safe Ziggurat implementation has been completely rewritten to prevent segfaults during cleanup
- The thread-safe implementation now uses a thread-local storage manager to prevent use-after-free errors
- Proper cleanup order is now enforced to ensure resources are freed without segfaults
- Box-Muller remains the more stable option for very high thread counts (>8)
- Thread-local resources are now properly managed throughout the entire lifecycle
- Thread exit detection prevents use of resources after threads terminate
- See THREAD_SAFETY.md for detailed guidance on thread-safe configuration

## Recommendations

- Update to this version to benefit from critical stability improvements
- Both Ziggurat and Box-Muller methods are now more stable for normal distribution generation
- For optimal thread-safe operation, use the following configuration:
  ```R
  createPRNG(list(
    use_threading = TRUE,         # Enable thread safety
    use_parallel_filling = FALSE, # Disable parallel filling for stability
    normal_method = "ziggurat"    # Both "ziggurat" and "box_muller" are supported
  ))
  ```

- For maximum thread safety, especially with many threads (>4), consider using Box-Muller:
  ```R
  createPRNG(list(
    use_threading = TRUE,         # Enable thread safety
    use_parallel_filling = FALSE, # Disable parallel filling for stability
    normal_method = "box_muller"  # Most stable option for intensive threading
  ))
  ```
  
- ⚠️ **CAUTION**: Parallel filling is not recommended due to potential stability issues:
  ```R
  createPRNG(list(
    use_threading = TRUE,         # Enable thread safety
    use_parallel_filling = FALSE, # STRONGLY RECOMMENDED: Keep this disabled for stability 
    normal_method = "ziggurat"    # Both "ziggurat" and "box_muller" are supported
  ))
  ```
- Refer to THREAD_SAFETY.md for detailed guidance on thread-safe usage

## Future Work

- Further enhance thread safety in all operations
- Improve warning handling for MPFR operations
- Optimize thread-safe performance for high-contention scenarios
- Extend caching mechanism to other computation-heavy initialization steps
- Add more statistical tests and benchmarks for distribution quality
