# Technical Documentation for the Quadratic Irrational PRNG

**Attribution**: The mathematical foundation and core algorithm design presented in this document is based on the work of Vincent Granville (2022), specifically his research on military-grade random number generators using quadratic irrationals. While Granville provided the original Python implementation, this document describes the R/C++ implementation developed for the qiprng package.

## Mathematical Foundation: The Quadratic Map

### Basic Principle

The core algorithm is based on a quadratic recurrence relation of the form:

$$x_{n+1} = (a \cdot x_n^2 + b \cdot x_n + c) \bmod 1$$

Where:
- $x_n$ is the current state (a value in [0,1])
- $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integer parameters
- $\bmod 1$ means we take the fractional part of the result

This is a discrete dynamical system derived from the theory of quadratic irrationals. When properly configured, this map exhibits chaotic behavior, making it suitable for random number generation.

### The Discriminant Requirement

The discriminant of the quadratic equation is defined as:

$$\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$$

**Why the discriminant must be positive:**

1. **Mathematical reasons**: A positive discriminant ensures that the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ has two distinct real roots. This is essential because:
   - When $\Delta > 0$, the quadratic map has two fixed points in the real domain
   - These fixed points create a bounded region where chaotic behavior occurs
   - The sequence will "bounce" unpredictably between these boundaries

2. **Randomness quality**: When the discriminant is positive, the sequence exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the "butterfly effect"), a hallmark of chaotic systems that produces high-quality randomness.

3. **Sequence behavior**:
   - Negative discriminant: The sequence would converge to a predictable pattern
   - Zero discriminant: The sequence would gravitate toward a single fixed point
   - Only a positive discriminant creates the necessary "stretching and folding" dynamic for chaos

### Orbit Structure

The sequence generated by this recurrence relation creates what mathematicians call an "orbit" in dynamical systems theory. With proper parameters, this orbit:

- Densely fills the interval [0,1]
- Never repeats exactly (with sufficient precision)
- Has a uniform distribution of points
- Exhibits exponential divergence of nearby starting values

## Parameter Constraints and Their Reasoning

### Parameter a

**Constraint**: $a > 0$ (must be positive)

**Reasoning**:
- Controls the "stretching" factor of the map
- If negative, would invert the parabola and destroy the chaotic properties
- If zero, would degenerate into a linear map with poor randomness
- Typical values: 1-10 for balanced chaos vs stability

### Parameter b

**Constraint**: No strict mathematical restriction, but typically $|b| < 20$

**Reasoning**:
- Acts as the "linear mixing" term
- Very large values can dominate the quadratic term, reducing nonlinearity
- Negative values are allowed and can enhance mixing
- Often chosen to make the discriminant square-free

### Parameter c

**Constraint**: Often negative to ensure positive discriminant

**Reasoning**:
- The "translation" parameter that shifts the map
- With $a > 0$ and $b^2 > 0$, a negative $c$ helps ensure $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac > 0$
- Controls the location of fixed points
- Affects the density of the orbit

### Square-Free Discriminant

The discriminant should ideally be square-free (not divisible by any perfect square except 1).

**Mathematical justification**: Quadratic irrationals with square-free discriminants have maximal period length in their continued fraction expansions, which translates to:
- Maximum complexity in the generated sequence
- Optimal distribution properties
- Resistance to linear predictability

## Implementation Enhancements

### Matrix Jump-Ahead with O(log n) Complexity

The v0.6.0 implementation includes an optimized jump-ahead algorithm using matrix exponentiation:

$$\begin{bmatrix} x_{n+1} \\ x_n \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_n^2 \\ x_n \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

Using binary exponentiation, we can compute $M^n$ in $O(\log n)$ operations, enabling efficient parallel stream generation.

### Advanced Mixing Strategies

Five mixing strategies combine outputs from multiple QI generators:

1. **Round Robin**: Sequential cycling through generators
2. **XOR Mixing**: Bitwise XOR of mantissas for maximum entropy
3. **Averaging**: Weighted average for smooth distribution
4. **Modular Addition**: Sum modulo 1 for entropy combining
5. **Cascade Mixing**: Three-pass mixing (XOR → modular → nonlinear)

### SIMD Vectorization

Hardware-optimized operations using:
- **AVX2/AVX512**: 4-8 doubles per operation on x86
- **ARM NEON**: 2 doubles per operation on Apple Silicon
- **Automatic fallback**: Scalar operations when SIMD unavailable

## High-Precision Arithmetic with MPFR

### Precision Levels

The implementation supports precision from 24 to 10,000 bits:
- **53 bits**: Standard double precision (default)
- **113 bits**: Quadruple precision for critical applications
- **256 bits**: High precision for cryptographic applications
- **1000+ bits**: Research and theoretical validation

### Precision Loss Mitigation

The conversion from MPFR to double uses extended precision intermediates:
```
MPFR(256-bit) → long double(80-bit) → double(53-bit)
```

This gradual reduction preserves more significant digits than direct conversion.

## Cryptographic Security Layer

### ChaCha20 Integration

The generator incorporates the ChaCha20 cipher for cryptographic mixing:
- 256-bit key derived from hardware entropy
- Per-thread nonce generation
- Periodic reseeding from system entropy pool

### Security Guarantees

- Forward secrecy: Past outputs cannot be reconstructed
- Backward secrecy: Future outputs cannot be predicted
- Side-channel resistance: Constant-time operations where possible

## Statistical Properties and Testing

### Validation Suite

The implementation has been validated with:
- **NIST Statistical Test Suite**: 15 tests for cryptographic randomness
- **Dieharder**: 114 tests from the GSL library
- **TestU01**: Crush, BigCrush, and Rabbit batteries
- **Custom tests**: Autocorrelation, spectral analysis, entropy measures

### Discriminant Quality

All 750 possible discriminants have been tested:
- **370 rated "Excellent"** (49.3% of total) - default configuration
- **213 rated "Good"** (28.4%)
- **167 rated "Fair"** (22.3%)

## Performance Characteristics

### Generation Speed

Single-threaded performance:
- **8.18 million values/second** on modern x86-64
- **Sub-122ns latency** per value
- **O(1) memory usage** with thread-local caching

### Parallel Scaling

Multi-threaded performance with OpenMP:
- Near-linear scaling up to physical core count
- Work-stealing queue for load balancing
- Lock-free buffer management

## Theoretical Background

### Connection to Continued Fractions

The quadratic irrational $\sqrt{\Delta}$ has a periodic continued fraction expansion:

$$\sqrt{\Delta} = a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1 + \cfrac{1}{a_2 + \cfrac{1}{\ddots}}}$$

The period length of this expansion directly relates to the complexity of our PRNG sequence.

### Ergodic Theory

The quadratic map satisfies the conditions for ergodicity:
- **Measure preservation**: The Lebesgue measure is preserved
- **Mixing property**: Correlation between states decays exponentially
- **Transitivity**: The orbit is dense in the state space

### Information-Theoretic Entropy

The theoretical entropy rate approaches the maximum:

$$H = -\sum_{i} p_i \log_2 p_i \approx 1 \text{ bit per bit}$$

This indicates optimal unpredictability in the binary representation.
