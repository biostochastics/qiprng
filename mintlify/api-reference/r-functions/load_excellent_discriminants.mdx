# Load and filter excellent discriminants from analysis results


 Loads discriminant analysis results and filters for those rated as "Excellent"
 based on comprehensive statistical testing. These discriminants have passed
 all major randomness tests and are suitable for production use.

## Usage

```r


load_excellent_discriminants(

  results_file = "discriminant_analysis_results/raw_results.rds",

  min_score = 0.85

)
```

## Parameters

<ParamField body="results_file" type="any">
  Path to the analysis results RDS file containing test results
 (default: "discriminant_analysis_results/raw_results.rds").
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="min_score" type="any">
  Minimum overall score threshold for excellent discriminants
 (default: 0.85).
</ParamField>

## Returns


- A data frame containing excellent discriminants with columns:

 a Quadratic coefficient
 b Linear coefficient
 c Constant term
 discriminant The discriminant value bÂ² - 4ac
 overall_score Combined test score (0-1)
 quality_rating Quality classification ("Excellent")
 uniformity_passed Logical; uniformity test result
 independence_passed Logical; independence test result
 autocorrelation_passed Logical; autocorrelation test result
 periodicity_passed Logical; periodicity test result


## Examples

## Details


- The function filters discriminants that:
-
- Have quality_rating == "Excellent"
- Have overall_score >= min_score (default 0.85)
- Have valid (non-NA) scores
-
-
- Results are sorted by overall_score in descending order.
