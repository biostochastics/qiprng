# Statistical Testing Framework for QPRNG


 A comprehensive framework for statistically testing the quality of
 random number generators. This module provides various test suites,
 visualizations, and reporting capabilities to assess PRNG performance.


## Details


 The framework includes:

  Basic distribution tests (uniformity, normality)
  Runs and independence tests
  Correlation tests (serial correlation, autocorrelation)
  Binary and bitwise tests
  Classical PRNG tests (chi-squared, Kolmogorov-Smirnov)
  Compression-based tests
  Optional integration with external test batteries


 All tests are designed with appropriate thresholds for reliability across
 different environments, including multi-threaded contexts.
