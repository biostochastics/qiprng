# Load discriminants from CSV file


 Loads discriminant parameters from a CSV file and validates their mathematical properties.
 The function checks that discriminants are correctly calculated and that all parameters
 meet the required constraints for the quadratic irrational PRNG.


## Usage

```r

 load_discriminants(file_path = "discriminants.csv")

```

## Parameters

<ParamField body="file_path" type="any">
  Path to discriminants.csv file (default: "discriminants.csv")
</ParamField>

## Returns


 A data frame containing discriminant parameters with columns:

 a Quadratic coefficient (must be > 0)
 b Linear coefficient
 c Constant term (must be < 0)
 Discriminant The discriminant value bÂ² - 4ac (must be > 0)



## Details


 The function performs several validation checks:

  Verifies that calculated discriminants match stored values
  Checks that a > 0 (required for proper quadratic behavior)
  Checks that c < 0 (required for the recurrence relation)
  Checks that discriminant > 0 (required for irrational roots)



## Examples

```r


 # Load default discriminants file
 discriminants <- load_discriminants()

 # Load from custom path
 discriminants <- load_discriminants("custom_discriminants.csv")


```
