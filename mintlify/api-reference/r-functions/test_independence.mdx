# Test independence using runs test


 Tests for independence in a sequence of random numbers by analyzing runs
 above and below the median. A run is a consecutive sequence of values
 that are all above or all below the median.


## Usage

```r

 test_independence(samples)

```

## Parameters

<ParamField body="samples" type="any">
  Numeric vector of random samples to test
</ParamField>

## Returns


 A list containing test results:

 test_name Name of the test
 statistic Z-score test statistic
 p_value Two-tailed p-value
 passed Logical; TRUE if p-value > 0.05
 interpretation Human-readable interpretation



## Details


 The runs test converts the sequence to binary (above/below median) and
 counts the number of runs. Under independence, the number of runs follows
 approximately a normal distribution with:

  Expected runs: E R  = (2 * n1 * n0) / n + 1
  Variance: Var R  = (2 * n1 * n0 * (2 * n1 * n0 - n)) / (nÂ² * (n - 1))

 where n1 = count above median, n0 = count below median, n = total count.


## Examples

```r


 # Test independence of random sequence
 samples <- runif(1000)
 result <- test_independence(samples)
 print(result$interpretation)


```
