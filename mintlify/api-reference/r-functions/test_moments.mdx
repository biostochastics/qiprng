# Test statistical moments (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis)


 Analyzes the first four statistical moments of a sample and compares them
 to the theoretical values expected for a uniform 0,1  distribution.


## Usage

```r

 test_moments(samples)

```

## Parameters

<ParamField body="samples" type="any">
  Numeric vector of random samples to test
</ParamField>

## Returns


 A list containing moment analysis results:

 test_name Name of the test
 sample_mean Calculated sample mean
 sample_variance Calculated sample variance
 sample_skewness Calculated sample skewness
 sample_kurtosis Calculated sample kurtosis (non-excess)
 expected_mean Expected mean for uniform 0,1  = 0.5
 expected_variance Expected variance for uniform 0,1  = 1/12
 expected_skewness Expected skewness for uniform 0,1  = 0
 expected_kurtosis Expected kurtosis for uniform 0,1  = 1.8
 mean_error Absolute deviation from expected mean
 var_error Absolute deviation from expected variance
 skew_error Absolute deviation from expected skewness
 kurt_error Absolute deviation from expected kurtosis



## Details


 For a uniform distribution on  0,1 , the theoretical moments are:

  Mean: μ = 0.5
  Variance: σ² = 1/12 ≈ 0.0833
  Skewness: γ₁ = 0 (symmetric distribution)
  Kurtosis: γ₂ = 1.8 (platykurtic, flatter than normal)


 The function uses non-excess kurtosis (where normal distribution = 3).


## Examples

```r


 # Analyze moments of uniform random numbers
 samples <- runif(10000)
 moments <- test_moments(samples)
 print(paste("Mean error:", round(moments$mean_error, 4)))


```
