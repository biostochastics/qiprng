# Reseed the PRNG


 Forces a manual reseed of the global PRNG instance. This operation introduces
 additional entropy into the generator, which can be useful for security-sensitive
 applications or to ensure sequence independence between different parts of
 a simulation.

## Usage

```r


reseedPRNG()
```

## Returns


 Invisibly returns NULL
  default PRNG

 createPRNG()Generate some values

 generatePRNG(10)Force a reseed

 reseedPRNG()Generate more values (new sequence after reseed)

 generatePRNG(10)

## Details


- Thread safety: This function is fully thread-safe and will block until mutex
- is acquired. The implementation ensures that all thread-local resources are
- properly handled during reseeding.
