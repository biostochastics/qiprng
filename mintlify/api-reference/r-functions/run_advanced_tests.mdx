# Comprehensive advanced test suite


 Runs all advanced statistical tests on a set of random samples, including
 entropy, gap, serial correlation, and poker tests. Each test evaluates
 different aspects of randomness quality.


## Usage

```r

 run_advanced_tests(samples)

```

## Parameters

<ParamField body="samples" type="any">
  Numeric vector of random samples to test (values in  0,1 )
</ParamField>

## Returns


 A list containing results from all advanced tests:

 entropy Results from Shannon entropy test
 gaps Results from gap test
 serial_correlation Results from serial correlation test
 poker Results from poker test

 Each test result includes test_name, passed status, and interpretation.
 Failed tests include error messages in the interpretation field.


## Details


 This function serves as a comprehensive test battery for advanced
 randomness evaluation. It runs the following tests:


   Shannon Entropy Test : Measures information content and
 unpredictability. High entropy indicates good randomness.
   Gap Test : Analyzes spacing between values in a range.
 Tests if gaps follow expected geometric distribution.
   Serial Correlation Test : Checks for dependencies between
 values at various lags. Low correlation indicates independence.
   Poker Test : Examines digit patterns in groups.
 Tests if patterns match theoretical probabilities.


 All tests include error handling to ensure the suite completes even
 if individual tests fail. Failed tests return an error message in the
 interpretation field.


## Examples

```r


 # Run all advanced tests on uniform random data
 samples <- runif(50000)
 results <- run_advanced_tests(samples)

 # Check which tests passed
 lapply(results, function(test) {
   paste(test$test_name, "-", test$result)
 })

 # Run tests on PRNG output
 library(qiprng)
 createPRNG()
 samples <- generatePRNG(50000)
 results <- run_advanced_tests(samples)


```
