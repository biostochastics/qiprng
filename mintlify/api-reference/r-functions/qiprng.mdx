# Quadratic Irrational PRNG Package


 Provides a high-quality, thread-safe pseudo-random number generator based on
 quadratic irrationals with optional cryptographic mixing.


## Details


 The QIPRNG package implements a high-precision pseudo-random number generator
 based on mathematical properties of quadratic irrational numbers. It features:


  Multiple probability distributions (uniform, normal, exponential, etc.)
  Optional cryptographic mixing for enhanced security
  Deterministic/reproducible mode with seed support (v0.2.7)
  Thread-safe implementation with mutex protection and thread-local storage
  Configurable precision using MPFR
  Jump-ahead capability for efficient sequence advancement
  Automatic reseeding for enhanced statistical quality
  Buffer management for performance optimization


 Key functions:

   createPRNG : Initialize a new PRNG with specified configuration
   generatePRNG : Generate random numbers from current configuration
   updatePRNG : Update PRNG configuration (change distribution, etc.)
   reseedPRNG : Force a manual reseed of the PRNG
   jumpAheadPRNG : Advance the PRNG sequence efficiently
   cleanupPRNG : Clean up PRNG resources when finished
