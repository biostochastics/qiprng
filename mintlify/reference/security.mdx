# Security Considerations

## Cryptographic Features

- ChaCha20 mixing for cryptographic security
- 256-bit internal state
- Constant-time operations to prevent timing attacks
- NIST SP 800-22 validated

## Best Practices

### Secure Seeding
```r
# Use cryptographic random seed
secure_seed <- as.integer(openssl::rand_bytes(4))
createPRNG(list(seed = secure_seed))
```

### Key Generation
```r
# Enable crypto mixing for key generation
createPRNG(list(
  use_crypto_mixer = TRUE,
  mixer_rounds = 20  # ChaCha20 rounds
))

# Generate cryptographic keys
key_bytes <- as.integer(generatePRNG(32) * 256)
```

## Security Warnings

<Warning>
  Do not use qiprng for cryptographic applications without enabling
  the crypto mixer. The base quadratic irrational algorithm alone
  is not cryptographically secure.
</Warning>

## Threat Model

qiprng with crypto mixing protects against:
- Statistical distinguishers
- Linear and differential cryptanalysis
- Time-memory trade-off attacks
- Side-channel attacks (constant-time operations)
