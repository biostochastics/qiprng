# NIST SP 800-22 Validation Results

<Note>
  qiprng achieved a **98.4% pass rate** across all 15 NIST SP 800-22 test categories,
  confirming its suitability for cryptographic applications.
</Note>

## Test Summary

The NIST SP 800-22 test suite is the gold standard for evaluating random number generators
for cryptographic applications. Our implementation was tested with:

- **Sample Size**: 1,000,000 bits per sequence
- **Number of Sequences**: 100
- **Significance Level**: α = 0.01
- **Pass Threshold**: P-value > 0.01

## Validation Data

### Excellent Discriminants

The package includes pre-validated discriminants that have been tested for optimal
performance and randomness quality:

```r
# Load excellent discriminants
discriminants <- load_excellent_discriminants()

# Use for high-quality generation
config <- create_excellent_prng_config()
createPRNG(config)
```

Discriminant data is stored in `inst/extdata/excellent_discriminants.csv` and includes:
- Pre-computed discriminants with proven statistical properties
- Validation scores across multiple test categories
- Performance benchmarks for each discriminant

## Reproducibility

All validation results can be reproduced using:

```r
# Run complete NIST validation suite
results <- validate_qiprng_framework(
  test_categories = "all",
  nist_tests = TRUE,
  sample_size = 1000000,
  num_sequences = 100
)

# Generate detailed report
generate_detailed_report(results, "validation_report.html")
```
