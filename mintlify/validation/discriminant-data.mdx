# Discriminant Data

## Overview

Quadratic irrational discriminants are the core mathematical foundation of qiprng.
The package includes carefully selected and validated discriminants that provide:

- **Proven randomness quality** through extensive statistical testing
- **Optimal performance** characteristics
- **Long periods** suitable for large-scale simulations
- **Cryptographic security** when combined with mixing functions

## Loading Discriminant Data

```r
# Load default excellent discriminants
discriminants <- load_excellent_discriminants()

# Load from custom file
custom_disc <- load_discriminants("path/to/discriminants.csv")

# Get recommended discriminants for specific use case
recommended <- get_recommended_discriminants(
  use_case = "cryptographic",
  min_period = 2^64
)
```

## Discriminant Structure

Each discriminant entry contains:

```r
# Example discriminant structure
list(
  discriminant = 163,        # Prime discriminant value
  a = "40.320...",          # Quadratic irrational coefficient a
  b = "1.0",                # Quadratic irrational coefficient b
  period_length = 2^63,      # Period before repetition
  validation_score = 0.994,  # Statistical quality score
  performance_rank = "A",    # Performance classification
  test_results = list(       # Detailed test results
    uniformity = 0.997,
    independence = 0.992,
    entropy = 0.995
  )
)
```

## Quality Metrics

All discriminants are validated against:

| Metric | Threshold | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Uniformity | > 0.99 | Distribution uniformity via KS test |
| Independence | > 0.99 | Serial correlation tests |
| Entropy | > 0.99 | Shannon entropy measure |
| Period | > 2^48 | Minimum period length |
| NIST Tests | > 0.98 | NIST SP 800-22 pass rate |

## Performance Classification

Discriminants are classified by performance:

- **Grade A**: Optimal for high-frequency generation (> 500 MB/s)
- **Grade B**: Good for general use (300-500 MB/s)
- **Grade C**: Suitable for high-precision applications (< 300 MB/s)

## Custom Discriminant Validation

```r
# Validate custom discriminant
validation_result <- test_discriminant(
  discriminant = 197,
  num_samples = 1000000,
  test_suite = "comprehensive"
)

# Assess quality
quality <- assess_discriminant_quality(validation_result)
print(quality$summary)
```
