<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents an <strong>enhanced comprehensive statistical analysis</strong> of random number quality for all 750 discriminant configurations in the QIPRNG (Quadratic Irrational Pseudo-Random Number Generator) package. Each discriminant represents a unique set of parameters (a, b, c) that satisfy the mathematical constraints for generating high-quality pseudorandom sequences based on quadratic irrational numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Key Enhancements in This Analysis:</strong> - <strong>Increased Statistical Power</strong>: 50,000 samples per discriminant (5x increase) - <strong>Enhanced Precision</strong>: 256-bit MPFR precision (2x increase) - <strong>Advanced Test Suite</strong>: 8 comprehensive statistical tests including entropy, gap, and poker tests - <strong>Multi-Method Periodicity Analysis</strong>: 5 different periodicity detection methods - <strong>Cryptographic Quality Assessment</strong>: Enabled cryptographic mixing for production-grade evaluation</p>

<p>This section provides a brief explanation of each statistical test used in the analysis, its purpose, and how to interpret the results.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Uniformity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov &amp; Chi-Squared)</strong>: The KS test compares the sample’s cumulative distribution to the ideal uniform distribution, while the Chi-Squared test checks if the frequency of numbers in different bins matches expectations. For both, a high p-value (&gt; 0.05) is good.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Independence (Wald-Wolfowitz Runs Test)</strong>: This test counts the number of “runs” (consecutive sequences above or below the median). An abnormal number of runs suggests a lack of independence. A high p-value (&gt; 0.05) is good.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Autocorrelation (Ljung-Box Test)</strong>: This test checks for non-zero correlations between a number and its predecessors at various lags. We look for no significant correlations, so a “pass” is good.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Periodicity (Fisher’s g-test)</strong>: This test uses a Fourier transform to find dominant, repeating cycles. A high p-value (&gt; 0.05) indicates no significant periodicity was found, which is good.</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Uniformity Performance</strong>: 90.7 % of discriminants produce uniform distributions</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Independence Performance</strong>: 94.5 % of discriminants generate independent sequences</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Autocorrelation Performance</strong>: NA % of discriminants show no significant autocorrelation</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Periodicity Performance</strong>: 97.5 % of discriminants show no detectable periodicity</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Parameter Correlation</strong>: The strongest correlation with quality is Parameter a (r = 0.1 )</p></li>

<p>All tested discriminants satisfy the fundamental mathematical constraints: - a &gt; 0 (positive coefficient) - c &lt; 0 (negative constant term) - Δ = b² - 4ac &gt; 0 (positive discriminant for chaotic behavior)</p>
<p>The analysis confirms that discriminants with higher values tend to produce better statistical properties, consistent with the theoretical expectation that larger discriminants provide more chaotic dynamics.</p>
