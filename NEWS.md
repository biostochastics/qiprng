# qiprng 0.7.0

## Critical Thread Safety & Build Fixes

### Thread Pool Shutdown Race Condition (H1)

* **Issue**: Thread pool `shutdown()` used `wait_for()` which returned before workers finished
* **Fix**: Replaced with blocking `join()` to guarantee all workers terminate
* **Impact**: Eliminates use-after-free during package unload

### Static Destruction Order Fiasco (H2)

* **Issue**: Global thread pool could be accessed after destruction during R shutdown
* **Fix**: Added explicit `shutdown_global_thread_pool()` called from `.onUnload`
* **Impact**: Prevents crashes and undefined behavior during package unload

### OpenMP TLS Cleanup Issue (H3)

* **Issue**: OpenMP pragmas in cleanup paths created new TLS entries during shutdown
* **Fix**: Removed OpenMP from `cleanup_thread_caches()` - cleanup is sequential
* **Impact**: Prevents use-after-free from late TLS allocation

### ThreadPool reset() Flaw (M1)

* **Issue**: `reset()` used `workers_.capacity()` which was unreliable
* **Fix**: Accept explicit thread count parameter, default to hardware_concurrency
* **Impact**: Ensures correct thread count after reset

## Build System Portability (C1)

* **Issue**: Hardcoded Homebrew paths broke builds on Linux and non-Homebrew macOS

## Package Infrastructure Fixes

### Validation Suite Paths (H4)

* **Fix**: Created `source_pkg_file()` helper using `system.file()` with development fallback
* **Files**: Moved statistical test files to `inst/statisticaltests/`
* **Impact**: Validation suite works for installed packages

### withTimeout Export (H5)

* **Issue**: `withTimeout` function was not exported but used by validation suite
* **Fix**: Added `@export` roxygen2 tag
* **Impact**: Validation suite accessible to users

## Algorithm Correctness Fixes

### CFE Period Bound (M2)

* **Issue**: `MAX_PERIOD` computed as `O(sqrt(D))` but CFE periods can be `O(sqrt(D) * log(D))`
* **Fix**: Added log term to period bound calculation
* **Impact**: Correct handling of large discriminants with long CFE periods

### DeterministicSeedHelper Entropy (M4)

* **Issue**: `std::random_device` returns zero entropy on some platforms
* **Fix**: Added fallback to high-resolution clock when entropy is zero
* **Impact**: Better fallback randomness when hardware entropy unavailable

### MPFRWrapper swap() (M8)

* **Issue**: Swapped MPFR handles without swapping state flags
* **Fix**: Swap `initialized_` and `cached_precision_` along with MPFR handles
* **Impact**: Correct state management after swap operations
