\title{Jump ahead in the PRNG sequence}
\usage{
jumpAheadPRNG(n)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of steps to jump ahead (positive integer or numeric value).
Can be very large (e.g., 1e9) as the implementation handles large jumps efficiently.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL
}
\description{
Advances the PRNG state by skipping ahead n numbers. This is significantly more
efficient than generating and discarding n numbers, as it uses an optimized
block processing approach to advance the quadratic recurrence.
}
\details{
The jump-ahead functionality is particularly useful for:
\itemize{
\item Parallel simulations where different workers need non-overlapping sequences
\item Subsampling from specific points in the random sequence
\item Skipping large segments without the computational cost of generation
}

The implementation uses block processing for cache efficiency, processing the
jump in chunks of 1024 steps for optimal performance. Performance scales
sub-linearly with jump size.

Note: Due to the security-focused design with random initialization, two PRNGs
created with identical parameters may start at different positions in the
sequence. The jump-ahead function advances from the current position, not from
a fixed origin.

Thread safety: This function is fully thread-safe and will block until mutex
is acquired. The implementation ensures proper synchronization of all thread-local
storage during jump-ahead operations.

\examples{
# Create default PRNG
createPRNG()

# Generate some initial values
initial_values <- generatePRNG(5)

# Jump ahead 1000 values
jumpAheadPRNG(1000)

# Generate values after the jump
after_jump_values <- generatePRNG(5)

# Large jumps are handled efficiently
jumpAheadPRNG(1e6)  # Jump ahead 1 million steps

# Use for parallel simulations
\dontrun{
# Worker 1: uses steps 0-999999
createPRNG()
worker1_values <- generatePRNG(1000000)

# Worker 2: uses steps 1000000-1999999
createPRNG()
jumpAheadPRNG(1000000)
worker2_values <- generatePRNG(1000000)
}
