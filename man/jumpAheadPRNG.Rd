\title{Jump ahead in the PRNG sequence}
\usage{
jumpAheadPRNG(n)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of steps to jump ahead (positive integer or numeric value)}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL
}
\description{
Advances the PRNG state by skipping ahead n numbers. This is significantly more
efficient than generating and discarding n numbers, as it uses mathematical properties
of quadratic irrationals to compute the state directly.
}
\details{
Thread safety: This function is fully thread-safe and will block until mutex
is acquired. The implementation ensures proper synchronization of all thread-local
storage during jump-ahead operations.
}
\examples{
# Create default PRNG
createPRNG()

# Generate some initial values
initial_values <- generatePRNG(5)

# Jump ahead 1000 values
jumpAheadPRNG(1000)

# Generate values after the jump
after_jump_values <- generatePRNG(5)
}
