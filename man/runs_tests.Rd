\title{Runs and independence tests for PRNG quality}
\description{
This module provides specialized tests to evaluate the independence properties
and run structure of the PRNG output. Run-based tests are particularly 
effective at detecting non-random patterns that might not be detected by
simple distribution tests.
}
\details{
The tests implemented in this module include:
\itemize{
  \item Standard runs test (above/below median)
  \item Run length tests (detecting abnormally long runs)
  \item Up/down runs test (detecting trends)
  \item Serial independence tests
  \item Lag-k autocorrelation tests
}

These tests are sensitive to sequential patterns and are essential for
cryptographic and simulation applications where independence between
successive values is critical.
