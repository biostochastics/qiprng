\title{Reseed the PRNG}
\usage{
reseedPRNG()
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL
}
\description{
Forces a manual reseed of the global PRNG instance. This operation introduces
additional entropy into the generator, which can be useful for security-sensitive
applications or to ensure sequence independence between different parts of
a simulation.
}
\details{
Thread safety: This function is fully thread-safe and will block until mutex
is acquired. The implementation ensures that all thread-local resources are
properly handled during reseeding.
}
\examples{
# Create default PRNG
createPRNG()

# Generate some values
generatePRNG(10)

# Force a reseed
reseedPRNG()

# Generate more values (new sequence after reseed)
generatePRNG(10)
}
