\description{
Provides a configurable pseudo-random number generator based on
quadratic irrationals with optional cryptographic mixing.
}
\details{
The QIPRNG package implements a high-precision pseudo-random number
generator based on quadratic irrational numbers. It supports various
output distributions including uniform, normal, and exponential.
Optional cryptographic mixing can be applied for enhanced security.
