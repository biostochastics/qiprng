\title{Basic distribution tests for PRNG quality}
\description{
This module provides fundamental statistical tests to evaluate the 
distributional properties of a PRNG, including tests for uniformity,
goodness-of-fit, and basic statistical properties.
}
\details{
The tests implemented in this module include:
\itemize{
  \item Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for uniformity
  \item Chi-squared goodness-of-fit test
  \item Mean and variance tests
  \item Min-max range tests
  \item Autocorrelation tests
}

These tests are designed to detect common issues in PRNGs such as
non-uniformity, clustering, and statistical bias.
