\title{Clean up PRNG resources}
\usage{
cleanupPRNG()
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL
}
\description{
Cleans up the global PRNG instance in a thread-safe manner. This function safely
releases all PRNG resources, including thread-local storage, memory buffers,
and cryptographic state.
}
\details{
Thread safety: This function implements a two-phase cleanup process that first
disables threading to prevent new generations during cleanup, then releases all
resources in a controlled manner. This approach ensures memory safety even in
multi-threaded environments.
}
\examples{
# Create PRNG
createPRNG()

# Use the PRNG
generatePRNG(10)

# Clean up when done
cleanupPRNG()
}
