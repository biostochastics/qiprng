\title{Combined visualization functions for PRNG testing}
\description{
This module provides functions for creating integrated visualizations
and comprehensive summary reports across different PRNG test categories.
Unlike the category-specific visualization modules, this module focuses
on creating combined views that help evaluate the overall quality of
random number generators.
}
\details{
Features include:
\itemize{
  \item Summary visualizations across all test categories
  \item Interactive HTML reports with drill-down capabilities
  \item Configurable dashboard generation
  \item Test result tables with statistics
  \item Comparative visualizations between different PRNGs
}

The visualizations integrate the results from all test categories into
a cohesive report that can be used for quality assessment and documentation.
