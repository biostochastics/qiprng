\title{Visualization functions for basic distribution tests}
\description{
This module provides specialized visualization functions for the results of
basic distribution tests in PRNG quality evaluation. The visualizations help
in identifying patterns and anomalies that might not be apparent from 
numerical test results alone.
}
\details{
The visualizations implemented include:
\itemize{
  \item Histograms with expected distribution overlays
  \item Q-Q plots comparing empirical vs. theoretical distributions
  \item Cumulative distribution function (CDF) comparisons
  \item Lag plots for visual identification of correlations
  \item Series plots to visualize the sequence of random numbers
}

All visualizations are generated using ggplot2 and saved in a structured
directory hierarchy for easy reference in reports.
