\title{Load and filter excellent discriminants from analysis results}
\usage{
load_excellent_discriminants(
  results_file = "discriminant_analysis_results/raw_results.rds",
  min_score = 0.85
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results_file}{Path to the analysis results RDS file containing test results
(default: "discriminant_analysis_results/raw_results.rds")}

\item{min_score}{Minimum overall score threshold for excellent discriminants
(default: 0.85)}
}
\value{
A data frame containing excellent discriminants with columns:
\describe{
\item{a}{Quadratic coefficient}
\item{b}{Linear coefficient}
\item{c}{Constant term}
\item{discriminant}{The discriminant value bÂ² - 4ac}
\item{overall_score}{Combined test score (0-1)}
\item{quality_rating}{Quality classification ("Excellent")}
\item{uniformity_passed}{Logical; uniformity test result}
\item{independence_passed}{Logical; independence test result}
\item{autocorrelation_passed}{Logical; autocorrelation test result}
\item{periodicity_passed}{Logical; periodicity test result}
}
}
\description{
Loads discriminant analysis results and filters for those rated as "Excellent"
based on comprehensive statistical testing. These discriminants have passed
all major randomness tests and are suitable for production use.
}
\details{
The function filters discriminants that:
\itemize{
\item Have quality_rating == "Excellent"
\item Have overall_score >= min_score (default 0.85)
\item Have valid (non-NA) scores
}

Results are sorted by overall_score in descending order.
}
\note{
Requires that discriminant analysis has been run and results saved.
Run \code{run_discriminant_analysis()} first if results file doesn't exist.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load excellent discriminants
excellent <- load_excellent_discriminants()

# Load with higher threshold
top_excellent <- load_excellent_discriminants(min_score = 0.90)
