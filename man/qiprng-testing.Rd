\title{Statistical Testing Framework for QPRNG}
\description{
A comprehensive framework for statistically testing the quality of
random number generators. This module provides various test suites,
visualizations, and reporting capabilities to assess PRNG performance.
}
\details{
The framework includes:
\itemize{
\item Basic distribution tests (uniformity, normality)
\item Runs and independence tests
\item Correlation tests (serial correlation, autocorrelation)
\item Binary and bitwise tests
\item Classical PRNG tests (chi-squared, Kolmogorov-Smirnov)
\item Compression-based tests
\item Optional integration with external test batteries
}

All tests are designed with appropriate thresholds for reliability across
different environments, including multi-threaded contexts.
