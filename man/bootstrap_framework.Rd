\title{Bootstrap Framework for Statistical P-value Calculations}
\description{
This module provides bootstrap-based methods for calculating p-values
and performing hypothesis tests, especially for situations where
analytical distributions are unknown or complex.
}
\details{
The framework includes:
\itemize{
\item Bootstrap p-value calculation using resampling
\item Permutation testing for non-parametric hypothesis tests
\item Monte Carlo p-value estimation via simulation
}

These methods are particularly useful for compression tests and other
statistical tests where the null distribution is not well-defined.
