\title{Comprehensive advanced test suite}
\usage{
run_advanced_tests(samples)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{Numeric vector of random samples to test (values in \link{0,1})}
}
\value{
A list containing results from all advanced tests:
\describe{
\item{entropy}{Results from Shannon entropy test}
\item{gaps}{Results from gap test}
\item{serial_correlation}{Results from serial correlation test}
\item{poker}{Results from poker test}
}
Each test result includes test_name, passed status, and interpretation.
Failed tests include error messages in the interpretation field.
}
\description{
Runs all advanced statistical tests on a set of random samples, including
entropy, gap, serial correlation, and poker tests. Each test evaluates
different aspects of randomness quality.
}
\details{
This function serves as a comprehensive test battery for advanced
randomness evaluation. It runs the following tests:

\itemize{
\item \strong{Shannon Entropy Test}: Measures information content and
unpredictability. High entropy indicates good randomness.
\item \strong{Gap Test}: Analyzes spacing between values in a range.
Tests if gaps follow expected geometric distribution.
\item \strong{Serial Correlation Test}: Checks for dependencies between
values at various lags. Low correlation indicates independence.
\item \strong{Poker Test}: Examines digit patterns in groups.
Tests if patterns match theoretical probabilities.
}

All tests include error handling to ensure the suite completes even
if individual tests fail. Failed tests return an error message in the
interpretation field.
}
\note{
For best results, provide at least 10,000 samples. Smaller sample
sizes may lead to inconclusive results for some tests.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Run all advanced tests on uniform random data
samples <- runif(50000)
results <- run_advanced_tests(samples)

# Check which tests passed
lapply(results, function(test) {
  paste(test$test_name, "-", test$result)
})

# Run tests on PRNG output
library(qiprng)

samples <- generatePRNG(50000)
results <- run_advanced_tests(samples)
