The `qiprng` package implements a cutting-edge pseudo-random number generator based on quadratic irrational numbers with advanced parallelization and hardware acceleration. It offers superior statistical properties, cryptographic security, and blazing-fast performance through modern CPU features.

```r
library(qiprng)
createPRNG()
x <- generatePRNG(10000)
hist(x, breaks = 50, main = "qiprng uniform distribution", col = "skyblue")
```

## Extended Statistical Distributions

Version 0.5.0 introduces advanced statistical distributions powered by the core QIPRNG engine:

### Levy Stable Distribution
Generate alpha-stable random variates using the Chambers-Mallows-Stuck algorithm:
```r
# Generate Levy stable random numbers
levy_samples <- generate_levy_stable(n = 1000, alpha = 1.5, beta = 0.5, mu = 0, sigma = 1)
# alpha: stability parameter (0,2], beta: skewness [-1,1]
```

### Pareto Distribution
Heavy-tailed distribution for modeling extreme events:
```r
# Generate Pareto distributed values
pareto_samples <- generate_pareto(n = 1000, xm = 1, alpha = 2.5)
# xm: scale (minimum value), alpha: shape parameter
```

### Cauchy Distribution
Fat-tailed distribution with undefined mean:
```r
# Generate Cauchy distributed values
cauchy_samples <- generate_cauchy(n = 1000, location = 0, scale = 1)
```

### Multivariate Normal Distribution
Generate correlated normal vectors (requires Eigen3):
```r
# Define mean and covariance
mean_vec <- c(0, 0, 0)
cov_mat <- matrix(c(1, 0.5, 0.2,
                    0.5, 1, 0.3,
                    0.2, 0.3, 1), 3, 3)
mvn_samples <- generate_multivariate_normal(n = 1000, mean_vec, cov_mat)
```

### Gaussian Copula
Model complex dependencies between different marginal distributions:
```r
# Define correlation and marginals
correlation <- matrix(c(1, 0.7, 0.7, 1), 2, 2)
marginals <- list(
  list(type = "cauchy", location = 0, scale = 1),
  list(type = "pareto", xm = 1, alpha = 3)
)
copula_samples <- generate_with_copula(n = 1000, correlation, marginals)
```

## Quality Assurance

### Comprehensive Discriminant Validation

The `qiprng` package has undergone rigorous quality analysis of all 750 possible discriminants. Each discriminant configuration was tested with 1,000,000 samples against our comprehensive statistical test suite.

**Validation Results:**

| Quality Rating | Count | Percentage | Description |
|----------------|-------|------------|-------------|
| Excellent | 370 | 49.3% | Passed all tests with p-values > 0.01 |
| Very Good | 324 | 43.2% | Minor deviations, suitable for most applications |
| Good | 50 | 6.7% | Acceptable for non-critical uses |
| Poor | 6 | 0.8% | Failed multiple tests, not recommended |

**Key Findings:**

- **370 Excellent Discriminants:** These parameter sets demonstrate exceptional statistical properties across all test categories
- **Robust Autocorrelation Testing:** Enhanced testing framework with stricter thresholds (max correlation < 0.010)
- **Production-Ready Selection:** Default configuration uses only the 370 excellent-rated discriminants
- **Statistical Guarantee:** 92.5% of discriminants rated "Good" or better, confirming the mathematical soundness

### Production-Ready Defaults

By default, qiprng uses only the 370 "Excellent" rated discriminants, ensuring maximum quality and reliability for production use:

```r
# Production configuration (default)
config <- list(
  use_excellent_only = TRUE,    # Use only validated excellent discriminants
  quality_threshold = 0.010     # Maximum autocorrelation threshold
)
```

For research or legacy compatibility:

```r
# Research configuration (all 750 discriminants)
config <- list(
  use_excellent_only = FALSE,   # Use all discriminants
  use_csv_discriminants = TRUE  # Load from discriminants.csv
)
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```r
library(qiprng)

# Create PRNG with default configuration
createPRNG()

# Generate 10,000 random numbers
x <- generatePRNG(10000)

# Basic statistical checks
mean(x)     # Should be close to 0.5 for uniform_01
var(x)      # Should be close to 1/12 for uniform_01
```

### v0.5.0 New Features

```r
# Advanced Mixing Strategies for improved randomness
cfg <- list(
  a = 2L, b = 5L, c = -2L,
  mixing_strategy = "xor_mixing",  # Options: round_robin, xor_mixing, averaging, modular_add, cascade
  use_parallel_filling = TRUE,     # Enable parallel buffer filling
  buffer_size = 100000             # Large buffer for parallel efficiency
)
createPRNG(cfg)

# Benchmark parallel vs sequential generation
system.time(vals <- generatePRNG(1000000))  # Parallel: ~0.5s on Apple Silicon M1

# Jump-ahead for independent parallel streams
cfg$offset <- 1000000  # Jump ahead 1M values
createPRNG(cfg)
stream2 <- generatePRNG(10000)  # Independent stream
```

### Advanced Example

```r
# Create PRNG with custom configuration
cfg <- list(
  a = 2L,                    # Quadratic coefficient (must be positive)
  b = 5L,                    # Linear coefficient
  c = -2L,                   # Constant term (must be negative)
  mpfr_precision = 128L,     # Precision in bits (24-10000)
  use_crypto_mixing = TRUE,  # Apply cryptographic mixing
  distribution = "normal",   # Output distribution
  normal_mean = 0,           # Mean for normal distribution
  normal_sd = 1              # SD for normal distribution
)
createPRNG(cfg)

# Generate normal random numbers
norm_samples <- generatePRNG(10000)
qqnorm(norm_samples)
qqline(norm_samples)

# Update to exponential distribution
updatePRNG(list(
  distribution = "exponential",
  exponential_lambda = 0.5   # Rate parameter (mean = 1/lambda)
))

# Generate exponential random numbers
exp_samples <- generatePRNG(10000)
hist(exp_samples, breaks = 50, main = "Exponential Distribution", col = "lightgreen")
```

### Thread-safe Example

```r
library(qiprng)
library(parallel)

# Create a thread-safe PRNG configuration
createPRNG(list(
  distribution = "normal",
  normal_method = "ziggurat",   # Both ziggurat and box_muller are supported and fully thread-safe
  use_threading = TRUE,         # Enable thread safety
  use_parallel_filling = FALSE, # For maximum stability
  buffer_size = 10000,          # Larger buffer for better performance
  debug = TRUE                  # Enable debug output
))

# Use parallel processing with the thread-safe PRNG
cl <- makeCluster(4)
clusterEvalQ(cl, library(qiprng))

# The same PRNG can now be safely used across parallel workers
results <- parSapply(cl, 1:4, function(i) {
  # Each worker gets values from the shared thread-safe PRNG
  values <- generatePRNG(5000)
  c(mean = mean(values), sd = sd(values))
})

stopCluster(cl)
print(results)
```

### Reproducible Random Numbers

For scientific computing and testing, you can enable fully reproducible sequences:

```r
# Set a seed for reproducibility
cfg <- list(
  seed = 12345,
  a = 2L,
  b = 5L,
  c = -2L
)
createPRNG(cfg)

# This will always produce the same sequence
set1 <- generatePRNG(100)

# Create another PRNG with the same seed
cleanup_prng()
createPRNG(cfg)
set2 <- generatePRNG(100)

# Verify they're identical
all(set1 == set2)  # TRUE
```

Note: When seed is provided, the PRNG uses deterministic initialization while maintaining all mathematical properties:
- **Discriminant selection**: When a seed is provided, discriminants are shuffled using a deterministic RNG seeded with the user's seed, providing reproducible but still randomized selection. Without a seed, discriminants are shuffled using the thread-local random RNG.
- **Warm-up period**: The generator performs 10,000-100,000 initial iterations to ensure proper mixing and unpredictable starting states.
- This mode is suitable for research and testing but should not be used when cryptographic randomness is required.

For full determinism with normal distributions, use `normal_method = "box_muller"` instead of the default ziggurat method, as the ziggurat implementation uses additional randomness for efficiency.

### MultiQI Mixing Strategies (v0.5.0)

The `qiprng` package now supports multiple quadratic irrationals working in ensemble with configurable mixing strategies for enhanced entropy:

```r
# Create PRNG with specific mixing strategy
cfg <- list(
  a = c(2, 3, 5),          # Multiple QI coefficients
  b = c(7, 11, 13),
  c = c(-3, -5, -7),
  mixing_strategy = "cascade_mix"  # Choose mixing strategy
)
createPRNG(cfg)

# Available mixing strategies:
# - "round_robin": Cycles through QIs sequentially (fastest)
# - "xor_mix": XOR combines outputs for bit diffusion
# - "averaging": Averages multiple QI outputs
# - "modular_add": Modular addition of outputs
# - "cascade_mix": Cascaded mixing for maximum entropy

# Update mixing strategy on the fly
updatePRNG(list(mixing_strategy = "xor_mix"))
```

Each mixing strategy offers different trade-offs between performance and entropy quality:
- **round_robin**: Best performance, good for general use
- **xor_mix**: Excellent bit diffusion, ideal for cryptographic applications
- **cascade_mix**: Maximum entropy mixing, best for high-security scenarios

### Jump-Ahead Example

```r
# The jump-ahead functionality allows efficient skipping in the sequence
createPRNG()

# Generate initial values
initial <- generatePRNG(5)

# Jump ahead 1 billion steps in the sequence - O(log n) complexity!
jumpAheadPRNG(1000000000)

# Generate values after the jump
after_jump <- generatePRNG(5)

# v0.5.0: Uses matrix exponentiation with MPFR arithmetic
# - O(log n) time complexity instead of O(n)
# - Can jump ahead by astronomical numbers efficiently
# - Maintains full precision and periodicity properties
```

### Running Tests

```r
library(qiprng)

# Quick test with default configuration
results <- test_prng(sample_size = 1e5)

# Comprehensive test suite
createPRNG()
suite <- create_prng_test_suite(
  prng_func = function(n) generatePRNG(n),
  config = default_test_config,
  categories = c("basic", "runs", "correlation", "binary")
)
results <- run_prng_test_suite(suite, save_report = TRUE)

# View results
print(results$summary)
```

### Test Configuration

```r
# Custom test configuration
config <- default_test_config
config$basic_sample_size <- 1e6      # Larger samples for basic tests
config$significance_level <- 0.01    # Stricter significance level
config$parallel <- TRUE              # Enable parallel processing
config$cores <- 4                    # Use 4 cores

# Run with custom config
results <- test_prng(config = config)
```

## Mathematical Foundation

The `qiprng` package implements a PRNG based on the recurrence relation:

```
x_{n+1} = (a * x_n^2 + b * x_n + c) mod 1
```

Where:
- a, b, and c are integer coefficients (with constraints: a > 0, c < 0, bÂ² - 4ac > 0)
- x_n is the current state in [0,1]
- x_{n+1} is the next state
- "mod 1" means taking the fractional part

The discriminant Î” = bÂ² - 4ac must be a non-perfect square to ensure the generated sequence has desirable randomness properties. The mathematical foundation is based on the ergodic theory of quadratic maps and the work of Vincent Granville (2022).

### Jump-Ahead Functionality (v0.5.0 Enhanced)

The `jumpAheadPRNG()` function allows you to efficiently advance the PRNG state by n steps without generating all intermediate values. Version 0.5.0 introduces a revolutionary O(log n) implementation using matrix exponentiation with MPFR arithmetic.

**Key Applications**:
- **Parallel simulations**: Different workers can jump to non-overlapping segments of the sequence
- **Reproducible subsampling**: Jump to specific points in the sequence for reproducible results
- **Astronomical jumps**: Can efficiently jump ahead by 10^18 steps or more

**v0.5.0 Implementation Details**:
- **Matrix exponentiation**: Uses 2x2 transformation matrices raised to powers via binary exponentiation
- **MPFR arithmetic**: All operations maintain full precision during matrix computations
- **O(log n) complexity**: Jump ahead by n steps in just logâ‚‚(n) matrix multiplications
- **Period-aware**: Leverages CFE period detection for correct modular arithmetic

**Technical Innovation**:
The jump-ahead transforms the quadratic map into matrix form:
```
[x_{n+1}]   [p q] [x_n]
[   1   ] = [0 1] [ 1 ]
```
Where the matrix can be efficiently raised to the nth power using binary exponentiation, reducing complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

### Performance Characteristics

The `qiprng` generator is designed for cryptographic-quality randomness rather than raw speed. In benchmarks, it is approximately 50x slower than standard generators like Mersenne Twister.

**Why the performance difference?**

1. **High-precision arithmetic**: qiprng uses MPFR (Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliable) library for arbitrary precision calculations, while standard generators use simple integer arithmetic
2. **Complex algorithm**: The quadratic irrational algorithm (x_{n+1} = frac(a*x_nÂ² + b*x_n + c)) requires 5 MPFR operations per number vs 1-2 integer operations for linear generators
3. **Cryptographic mixing**: Optional ChaCha20 mixing adds additional security at a computational cost
4. **Thread safety**: Comprehensive mutex protection and thread-local resources add synchronization overhead

**This is a deliberate trade-off**: qiprng prioritizes cryptographic security and mathematical rigor over speed. Use it when you need:
- Cryptographic-quality randomness
- Quantum-inspired unpredictability
- Precise control over statistical properties
- Enhanced security features

For general statistical sampling where speed is critical and cryptographic security is not required, standard generators remain the better choice.
