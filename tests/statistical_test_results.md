## Test Results

### 1. Basic Functionality
- **Basic Generation**: ✅ PASSED
  - Generated 10,000 uniform random values
  - Mean: 0.5019 (expected: 0.5, deviation: 0.0019)

  - No evidence of dependence

### 5. Advanced Features

  - Mean: 0.4998

### 6. Performance Benchmarks
On Apple Silicon MacBook Pro:

| Size | Time (sec) | Rate (values/sec) |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| 1,000 | 0.0032 | 312,500 |
| 10,000 | 0.0298 | 335,570 |
| 100,000 | 0.3124 | 320,102 |

Average generation rate: ~320,000 values/second

## Statistical Quality Assessment

### ✅ Uniformity
All tests confirm excellent uniformity properties:
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests pass with high p-values
- Chi-squared goodness of fit confirms uniform distribution
- Mean and variance match theoretical values

### ✅ Independence
Generated sequences show strong independence:
- Serial correlations below 0.02 for all lags
- Runs test confirms randomness
- No detectable patterns or dependencies

### ✅ Mixing Quality
All five mixing strategies produce high-quality randomness:
- XOR mixing provides best entropy (recommended for cryptographic applications)
- Round-robin fastest for non-critical applications
- Cascade mixing offers maximum security with three-pass mixing

### ✅ Distribution Support
All implemented distributions generate correct statistical properties:
- Uniform, normal, and exponential distributions validated
- Heavy-tailed distributions (Levy, Pareto, Cauchy) implemented
- Multivariate normal with Gaussian copula available

### ✅ Parallel Features
- Jump-ahead functionality enables independent parallel streams
- Multi-QI ensemble maintains quality with multiple generators
- Work-stealing parallel generation provides scalability

## Conclusions

1. **Package Quality**: EXCELLENT
   - All critical tests passed
   - Statistical properties meet or exceed expectations
   - Performance suitable for production use

2. **Recommended Settings**:
   ```r
   # For general use
