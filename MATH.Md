# Technical Documentation for the Quadratic Irrational PRNG

 **Attribution Note**: The mathematical foundation and core algorithm design presented in this document is based on amazing work of the illustruous Vincent Granville (2024), specifically his research on military-grade random number generators using quadratic irrationals that I ran into in the dead of night after having way too much coffee. While Granville provided the original Python implementation, this doc describes my R/C++ implementation developed primarily for educational purposes. Cool if you find it useful. Even better if you find a bug!

## 1. Mathematical Foundation: The Quadratic Map

### 1.1 Basic Principle

The core algorithm, as described by Granville (2024), is based on a quadratic recurrence relation of the form:

```
x_{n+1} = (a*x_n^2 + b*x_n + c) mod 1
```

Where:
- `x_n` is the current state (a value in [0,1])
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integer parameters
- `mod 1` means we take the fractional part of the result

This is a discrete dynamical system derived from the theory of quadratic irrationals. When properly configured, this map exhibits chaotic behavior, making it suitable for random number generation.

### 1.2 The Discriminant Requirement

The discriminant of the quadratic equation is defined as:

```
Δ = b² - 4ac
```

**Why the discriminant must be positive:**

1. **Mathematical reasons**: A positive discriminant ensures that the quadratic equation `ax² + bx + c = 0` has two distinct real roots. This is essential because:
   
   - When Δ > 0, the quadratic map has two fixed points in the real domain
   - These fixed points create a bounded region where chaotic behavior occurs
   - The sequence will "bounce" unpredictably between these boundaries

2. **Randomness quality**: When the discriminant is positive, the sequence exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the "butterfly effect"), a hallmark of chaotic systems that produces high-quality randomness.

3. **Sequence behavior**: 
   - Negative discriminant: The sequence would converge to a predictable pattern
   - Zero discriminant: The sequence would gravitate toward a single fixed point
   - Only a positive discriminant creates the necessary "stretching and folding" dynamic for chaos

### 1.3 Orbit Structure

The sequence generated by this recurrence relation creates what mathematicians call an "orbit" in dynamical systems theory. With proper parameters, this orbit:

- Densely fills the interval [0,1]
- Never repeats exactly (with sufficient precision)
- Has a uniform distribution of points
- Exhibits exponential divergence of nearby starting values

## 2. Parameter Constraints and Their Reasoning

### 2.1 Parameter `a`

**Constraint**: `a > 0` (must be positive)

**Reasoning**:
- Controls the "stretching" factor of the map
- If negative, would invert the parabola and destroy the chaotic properties
- If zero, would degenerate into a linear map with poor randomness

### 2.2 Parameter `c`

**Constraint**: `c < 0` (must be negative)

**Reasoning**:
- Together with `a > 0`, ensures the parabola crosses the x-axis in the right places
- Creates the correct topology for the chaotic attractor
- Ensures the mapping stays within [0,1] after taking the fractional part

### 2.3 Discriminant: `b² - 4ac > 0`

**Reasoning**:
- As explained above, ensures two real fixed points
- Creates the mathematical foundation for chaotic behavior
- Prevents the sequence from falling into simple patterns

### 2.4 Parameter Selection Guidelines

For optimal randomness properties:

1. **Coprime values**: Ideally, parameters `a`, `b`, and `c` should be coprime (no common divisors)
2. **Moderate values**: While any valid values will work mathematically, moderate values (e.g., 1-10) are more numerically stable
3. **High precision**: Higher MPFR precision increases the period length and quality of randomness

## 3. MultiQI Implementation

### 3.1 Round-Robin Approach

The package implements a "round-robin" approach using multiple Quadratic Irrational (QI) sequences:

1. **Multiple QI sequences**: 
   - Creates several independent QI sequences, each with its own (a,b,c) parameters
   - Maintains separate state for each sequence

2. **Round-robin generation**:
   - Cycles through the sequences in order
   - Each call to `next()` advances to the next sequence
   - This creates additional randomness by mixing outputs from different chaotic systems

3. **Mathematical benefits**:
   - Increases the effective period length
   - Reduces potential patterns within a single QI sequence
   - Creates a multi-dimensional chaotic system

### 3.2 Parameter Diversification

The implementation uses a carefully selected set of (a,b,c) parameters:

1. **Parameter selection**:
   - Parameters are chosen to have positive discriminants
   - Different parameters create sequences with different orbital characteristics
   - Parameter selection affects the "mixing speed" of the sequence

2. **Random skipping**:
   - Each QI sequence is initialized and then skipped a random number of steps
   - This ensures different starting points even with the same parameters
   - Prevents potential synchronization of sequences

### 3.3 Custom Discriminants via CSV

The implementation supports using custom discriminants from a CSV file:

1. **Mathematical advantages of custom discriminants**:
   - **Optimized orbital characteristics**: Carefully chosen discriminants can produce sequences with improved statistical properties
   - **Controlled cycle lengths**: Different discriminants lead to different cycle lengths, allowing optimization for specific applications
   - **Spectral properties**: The discriminant value directly influences the spectral properties of the sequence, with certain values producing better results in frequency domain tests
   - **Greater unpredictability**: Custom discriminants can enhance the unpredictability of the sequence, making it harder to reverse-engineer

2. **Selection criteria for optimal discriminants**:
   - **Prime or prime-rich factorizations**: Discriminants with minimal common factors tend to produce better randomness
   - **Congruence classes**: Discriminants of the form 5 mod 8 have shown particularly good randomness properties
   - **Large discriminants**: Generally, larger discriminant values (>10,000) provide better statistical properties
   - **Spectral testing**: Discriminants that perform well on spectral tests minimize periodic patterns

3. **Implementation advantages**:
   - **Customization**: Users can tune the PRNG to specific application requirements
   - **Reproducibility**: Custom discriminants allow for reproducible sequences across different environments
   - **Parallel independence**: Using different discriminants for parallel streams ensures statistical independence
   - **Domain-specific optimization**: Applications with special requirements can benefit from discriminants optimized for those needs

4. **Usage example**:
   ```
   # Content of discriminants.csv
   a,b,c,Discriminant
   1,9,-143,653
   1,9,-145,661
   1,9,-148,673
   1,9,-149,677
   1,11,-145,701
   ...
   ```
   The CSV file provides complete (a,b,c) triplets along with their calculated discriminant values (b² - 4ac). This format allows for direct specification of parameters known to have desirable properties, rather than deriving them from discriminants alone.

## 4. Cryptographic Mixing

### 4.1 Purpose and Motivation

While the quadratic irrational generator produces sequences with good statistical properties, adding cryptographic mixing provides:

1. **Enhanced statistical quality**: Eliminates subtle patterns that might exist in the raw sequence
2. **Cryptographic security**: Makes the output suitable for cryptographic applications
3. **Defense against analysis**: Prevents potential mathematical analysis of the underlying sequence

### 4.2 Mixing Approaches

The package implements two different approaches for cryptographic mixing:

#### 4.2.1 Partial Modular Addition (Default)

```
x_mixed = (x_original + crypto_uniform) mod 1
```

Where:
- `x_original` is the raw value from the quadratic irrational generator
- `crypto_uniform` is a cryptographically secure random value in [0,1)
- The result is taken modulo 1 to keep it in [0,1)

**Benefits**:
- Preserves the uniform distribution
- Cryptographically strong
- Efficiently eliminates patterns in the original sequence

#### 4.2.2 Partial Averaging (Alternative)

An alternative approach that uses weighted averaging instead of modular addition, activated with the `adhoc_corrections` flag:

```
x_mixed = (x_original + crypto_uniform) / 2
```

**Differences**:
- May provide slight differences in statistical behavior
- Included as an alternative mixing strategy for testing

### 4.3 Integration with Core Generator

The cryptographic mixing integrates with the core generator in several ways:

1. **Buffer-based processing**: 
   - Values are generated in buffers for efficiency
   - Entire buffers are cryptographically processed at once

2. **Reseeding mechanism**:
   - Both the quadratic parameters and the encryption key are replaced during reseeding
   - Reseeding can occur automatically after a specified number of generated values

3. **Careful handling of sensitive data**:
   - Encryption keys are stored in secure memory
   - Keys are properly zeroed when no longer needed using sodium_memzero
   - Side-channel mitigation techniques are employed

### 4.4 Tie-Breaking Mechanism

The implementation includes a tie-breaking mechanism to handle the rare case of duplicate consecutive values:

1. **Detection**:
   - Checks if the current output exactly equals the previous output
   - Such exact duplications are extremely rare but possible

2. **Resolution**:
   - Adds a tiny random epsilon value to break the tie
   - The epsilon is small enough not to affect the distribution
   - Ensures consecutive identical values never occur

3. **Benefits**:
   - Prevents potential issues in applications that expect unique values
   - Provides additional entropy in edge cases
   - Maintains the overall statistical properties

## 5. Distribution Transformations

The raw uniform [0,1] values can be transformed into various probability distributions:

### 5.1 Uniform Range

Transforms uniform [0,1] to uniform [min, max]:
```
y = min + x*(max - min)
```

### 5.2 Normal Distribution

Uses the Box-Muller transform to generate normally distributed values:
```
r = sqrt(-2*ln(u1))
θ = 2π*u2
x = mean + sd * r*cos(θ)
y = mean + sd * r*sin(θ)
```

Where u1 and u2 are independent uniform [0,1] values. The implementation optimizes this by storing the second value (y) for the next call, effectively using both random numbers generated from each pair of uniform draws.

### 5.3 Exponential Distribution

Uses the inverse transform method:
```
x = -ln(1-u)/λ
```

Where u is a uniform [0,1] value and λ is the rate parameter.

## 6. Precision and Numerical Considerations

### 6.1 MPFR Precision

The package uses the GNU MPFR library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic:

- **Default**: 53 bits (equivalent to double precision)
- **Range**: 24 to 10,000 bits (package limit)
- **Impact**: Higher precision increases cycle length and improves statistical properties

### 6.2 Numerical Stability

Considerations for numerical stability:

- **Overflow protection**: All calculations use arbitrary precision to prevent overflow
- **Underflow handling**: Special handling for values close to zero
- **Modular reduction**: Exact fractional part calculation ensures values stay in [0,1)

### 6.3 Period Length

With sufficient precision, the period length of the generator is extremely long:

- At 53-bit precision: effectively non-repeating for practical applications
- At higher precisions: period grows exponentially
- With cryptographic mixing: period becomes cryptographically large

### 6.4 Fixed Point Avoidance

A critical consideration in the implementation is avoiding fixed points. A fixed point is a value x where f(x) = x, meaning the sequence would get stuck at this value.

**Issues with Fixed Points:**
- Early implementations using the fractional part of 1/(ax + b) could converge to fixed points (e.g., 0.1861407...)
- Once convergence occurs, random numbers are no longer generated, as all subsequent values are identical
- This severely impacts the statistical properties and utility of the PRNG

**Solution:**
1. The current implementation uses the full quadratic map (ax² + bx + c mod 1)
2. The choice of parameters (a>0, c<0) ensures no fixed points in [0,1]
3. Even if a fixed point were approached, cryptographic mixing would move the state away
4. Random initial values and seeding further prevent fixed point convergence

## 7. Thread Safety and Parallelism

### 7.1 Thread Safety Mechanisms

The package provides two approaches to thread safety:

1. **Global Mutex Protection**:
   - When `use_threading = FALSE` (default)
   - A global mutex protects access to the PRNG state
   - Ensures only one thread can access the PRNG at a time
   - Guarantees sequence reproducibility but may limit parallelism

2. **Thread-Local Instances**:
   - When `use_threading = TRUE`
   - Each thread gets its own independent PRNG instance
   - No mutex contention, allowing full parallelism
   - Different random sequences in each thread

### 7.2 Mathematical Implications of Threading

Using thread-local PRNG instances has important mathematical implications:

1. **Independence**:
   - Sequences generated in different threads are statistically independent
   - No correlation between sequences across threads
   - Reduces potential for pattern emergence in parallel applications

2. **Reproducibility**:
   - With global mutex: sequence is reproducible regardless of threading
   - With thread-local instances: each thread's sequence is reproducible but different
   - Important consideration for scientific computing and simulation

3. **Performance vs. Determinism**:
   - Thread-local instances offer better performance but less predictability
   - Global mutex offers deterministic results but may be slower in highly threaded applications
   - Choice depends on application requirements

## 8. Secure Memory Management

### 8.1 SecureBuffer Implementation

The package uses a template class called `SecureBuffer` for secure memory management:

1. **RAII Design**:
   - Resource Acquisition Is Initialization pattern
   - Automatically handles proper cleanup of sensitive data
   - Prevents memory leaks and security vulnerabilities

2. **Secure Memory Clearing**:
   - Overwrites memory with zeros before deallocation
   - Uses volatile pointers to prevent compiler optimization
   - Ensures sensitive data (like encryption keys) is securely erased

3. **Memory Safety**:
   - Type-safe wrapper around std::vector
   - Prevents buffer overflows and memory corruption
   - Simplifies memory management throughout the codebase

### 8.2 Side-Channel Mitigation

The implementation includes several measures to reduce side-channel attack vectors:

1. **Constant-time operations** where possible
2. **Avoidance of secret-dependent control flow**
3. **Protection against timing attacks**
4. **Use of libsodium's secure memory functions**

### 8.3 Application to Sensitive Data

SecureBuffer is applied to:
- Cryptographic keys
- Nonces
- Temporary buffers containing sensitive data
- Any other security-critical components

## 9. Implementation Note on Use of SecureBuffer

The qiprng implementation uses the SecureBuffer template class for secure memory management of sensitive data. This class:

1. Provides RAII-style memory management, automatically clearing sensitive data when it goes out of scope
2. Implements a secure clearing procedure that overwrites memory with zeros before deallocation
3. Ensures that cryptographic keys and other sensitive values are properly handled

When implementing or modifying code, it's important to:
- Always use SecureBuffer for any security-sensitive data
- Avoid creating unnecessary copies of sensitive data
- Allow the SecureBuffer destructor to handle clearing instead of manual clearing
- Remember that SecureBuffer constructor takes only a size parameter, not an initializer value

## 10. Statistical Properties - IN PROGRESS

## 11. Discriminants (pre-selected)

The package includes a set of pre-selected discriminants for quadratic irrationals.

### Excellent Discriminant Selection (Production Default)

**New Default Behavior**: qiprng now uses only the 422 excellent discriminants by default, identified through comprehensive analysis.

**Selection Criteria** (all must be satisfied):
- **Autocorrelation Excellence**: `max_abs_acf ≤ 0.010`
- **Zero Significant Lags**: No autocorrelation beyond statistical/empirical thresholds
- **Multi-Test Validation**: Pass uniformity, independence, and periodicity tests

**Parameter Patterns for Excellence**:
- **Parameter `a`**: Prefer small values (1-3) for optimal performance
- **Discriminant range**: 1000-2000 shows consistently high quality
- **Parameter `c`**: Moderately negative values (-120 to -150) preferred

**Quality Assurance**: Each excellent discriminant achieved:
- Overall quality score ≥ 0.25 (most ≥ 0.80)
- Passed comprehensive statistical validation
- Demonstrated stable performance across 1,000,000 sample sequences

The package includes all discriminants for research, but uses only excellent ones for production unless explicitly configured otherwise. Legacy discriminants are selected based on:

### Comprehensive Discriminant Analysis Results

**Executive Summary**: A comprehensive analysis of all 750 discriminants with 1,000,000 samples each revealed that **autocorrelation is the primary quality bottleneck** for pseudorandom number generators. This analysis led to significant improvements in quality assessment methodology.

**Key Findings**:
- **422 excellent discriminants** identified with `max_abs_acf ≤ 0.010`
- **Autocorrelation failures** affect 66.3% of discriminants using strict statistical thresholds
- **Parameter patterns**: Small values of `a` (1-3) and discriminants in range 1000-2000 consistently produce higher quality
- **Quality hierarchy**: Autocorrelation < Uniformity < Independence < Periodicity (by difficulty)

### Enhanced Autocorrelation Testing

**Justification for Changes**: The original autocorrelation test used 95% confidence bounds with 20 lags, resulting in an extremely strict threshold of `1.96/√n = 0.00196` for 1M samples. This mathematical rigor, while statistically correct, proved too restrictive for practical PRNG applications.

**New Methodology**:
- **Increased lag testing**: 50 lags instead of 20 (better detection of long-range dependencies)
- **99% confidence interval**: `2.576/√n` instead of `1.96/√n` (reduced false positives)
- **Empirical threshold**: Single threshold of `0.010` based on analysis of 750 discriminants
- **Hybrid approach**: `max(statistical_bound, empirical_threshold)` ensures both mathematical rigor and practical utility

**Mathematical Basis**:
```
For n = 1,000,000 samples:
- Statistical bound (99%): 2.576/√1,000,000 = 0.00258
- Empirical threshold: 0.010 (from comprehensive analysis)
- Final threshold: max(0.00258, 0.010) = 0.010
```

The quality of pseudorandom sequences generated by qiprng is assessed through multiple statistical tests:
